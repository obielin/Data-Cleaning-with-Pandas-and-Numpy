# Data-Cleaning-with-Pandas-and-Numpy
This project involves a detailed data cleaning process, documented in a Jupyter notebook. 
The Jupyter notebook contains detailed steps and methodologies used to transform the raw data into a more usable form.

### Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the [FIFA 21 Messy Raw Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring?select=fifa21+raw+data+v2.csv) gottenfrom Kaggle. It includes various player attributes and performance metrics from the popular video game FIFA 21.

### Objectives
The main objectives of the data cleaning process include:

* Handling missing values
* Correcting data types
* Data transformation for better analysis

### Methodology
The Jupyter notebook details the following steps:

Initial Data Exploration: Basic exploration to understand the structure and issues in the dataset.
Data Cleaning:
* Handling missing values: Strategies used to fill or remove missing data.
* Data type corrections: Converting data into appropriate types.
* Data Transformation: Methods used for transforming data into a more analyzable format.
  * Removing currency preffixes
  * Converting unit siffixes
